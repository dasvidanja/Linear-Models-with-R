# Linear-Models-with-R
In this repository I will be uploading my assignments/reports for what it pertain my course in Linear Models with R. The course is an overview of Regression, and its application through R. This is a master's course. As a result, it attemps to cover both theory & practice with a depth that allows for a more than necessary understanding of liner models. The book that will be used in this course is by Farawy, Julian "Linear Models with R." I am quite fond of this book. Altough, sometimes it leaves me with a need to better understand the theory, it does a great job at going over concepts application and R. The reports will be made by using R-markdown, which I am still in the process of learning & quite excited about its usefulness.
